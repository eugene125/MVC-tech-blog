## Description

The MVC tech blog was intended to connect the front end and back end, allowing a user to create a blog post and comment on other people's blog posts. However, with the difficulties of using handlebars, I was unable to get the website working as planned.

## Installation

Open a terminal and type in npm install. Doing so will install the node packages I used on this homework assignment.
